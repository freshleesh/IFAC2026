"""Warm-start utilities for rolling-horizon SQP.

Given previous cycle's solution d_{k-1}(s) defined on s-grid S_{k-1}, and the
ego having advanced by Δs = v_ego * dt during the solve-tick, we want an
initial guess for cycle k defined on a (possibly different) s-grid S_k.

Implementation is a simple linear interpolation with s-axis shift:
    d_init^k(s) = d_{k-1}(s + Δs)
clamped at the edges. If the previous solution is None, the caller should use
the analytic fallback (constant apex guess) from the original SQP spliner.
